# AI_Native_Journey

## 📍 Overview
This repository tracks my learning, projects, and reflections from Pursuit's AI Native Program (June 2025).  
As someone with a background in clinical research and software development, I’m using AI-native tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini to explore real-world applications in healthcare, cybersecurity, and automation.

## 🧰 Tools & Tech Stack
- Cursor IDE (AI-powered coding)
- GitHub + GitHub Desktop
- Gemini / ChatGPT
- JavaScript, Node.js, React
- PostgreSQL (planned)
- Healthcare APIs (TBD)

## 🧠 Goals
- Build a clinical AI project (e.g., symptom tracker or automated note assistant)
- Learn to collaborate with AI for debugging, design, and testing
- Create a portfolio-ready app by the end of the program

## 📌 Next Steps
- [ ] Finalize project idea
- [ ] Set up folder structure
- [ ] Create basic front-end & integrate AI prompt flows
